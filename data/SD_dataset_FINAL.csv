Don't treat women like an object.,0
I hope no single broad tries to swerve me but a woman's ultimate position is to be by a man,1
EVERY girl is crazy no exceptions.,1
"Only females recognise the ""final spin"" on a washing machine full of clothes",1

We all get bored of women. They stop making sense after sometime. Especially the talking part.,1
I can't stand working in an office with women who gossip the entire time,1
Maybe so. But I'm still right.,0
I need a girl that'll iron my shirts and not call me sexist,1
Men are far more civilised during these debates than women.,1

This girl across from me has a jungle on each leg. Please shave.,1
I do believe that women are inferior to men.,1
"If women ruled the world, there would be no war at all. Just a bunch of countries that wouldn't talk to each other!",1
You don't understand my intent,0
How are girls so bad at math when they know so much about hair volume and the volume of their mascara,1
Typical woman sticking her nose where she shouldn't,1
"A chick shouldn't be able to say ""I'm on my period i don't feel good"" and not have to work.",1
Feminists annoy the shit out of me,1
I dont like dealing with women when there is business to do. They are too emotional,1
Guys are better than women in everything. It's not sexist but it's just because we are competitive as hell,1
Again and again I am reminded harshly that having a women boss truly sucks,1
I'm not sexist but on my life theres a gene in women that blocks their rationality.,1
It's of note when a woman surprises me with her competence.,1
everyone and their mothers must stop acting like men,1
The reason liberal women are liberal is because they have to date liberal men,1
"A lot of females try to think like a man to avoid getting hurt/played instead of just being a woman. Take a chance, love again.",1
Insecure feminists created a day without women.,1
What will we do without feminists?! Everything.,1

Covered girls are better than cover girls,1
Truly a day without women should be renamed a day without cry baby feminists. No respectable lady with a real life acknowledge it.,1
Did u know ABCDEFG means A boy can do everything for a girl. The Reverse GFEDCBA means Girl forget everything done and catches new boy again.,1
"Sorry, but real women show up for their commitments.",1
I don't care how hard you think you are if you cant act like a man no one will respect you,1
